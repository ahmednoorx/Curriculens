# Curriculum Assistant

This project is a Curriculum Assistant built with Streamlit that leverages open-source models for text generation and supports PDF/DOCX parsing. It provides functionalities to generate text based on user prompts, parse documents, and export content in various formats.

## Features

- **Text Generation**: Utilizes open-source models (e.g., Falcon via Groq or Hugging Face) to generate text based on user input.
- **PDF Parsing**: Extracts text from PDF files for easy manipulation and analysis.
- **DOCX Parsing**: Extracts text from DOCX files, allowing users to work with Microsoft Word documents.
- **Export Options**: Users can export generated content as PDF or DOCX files.
